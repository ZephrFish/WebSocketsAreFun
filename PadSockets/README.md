# PadSockets

Initially uses a base of [Pad](https://github.com/petercunha/Pad) but with some additonal features rolled in.

Setup:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install npm git -y
```

Requirements
------------

  * Node 6.x or later
  * Required Node packages
  * Open port, if you want a public site

As long as you have Node 6 installed, you can just `git clone` and `npm install` and you'll be ready to roll!

Run your own server!
--------------------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZephrFish/PadSockets
cd PadSockets
npm install && npm start
```

Now we have a pad listening on port 80 so go to whatever your DNS/IP is on port 80 and you'll have a new pad
